·If the value of b >> a then the result doesn't converge, since the algorithm isn't able to create the functions in the given number of iterations
·The fact that the algorithm converges quickly maeans that the data is clearly linearly separable
·Low error interval shows that the amount of samples during testing was more than enough

Expressions
·For most values of a and b the results plateau at the same aproximated error, showing there that the training data isn't represetntive of the testing set
·Hgiher number of tierations until convergance shows that the data isn't as easy to separate, but is still linearly separable
·Big error interval shows that there's too few testing data

Gaus2D:
·No combination of a and b could converge, showing that the data wasn't linearly separable
·Spite of that the low error intervals shows that there was abundant number of data, therefore the problem is on the data not being separable

Gender:
·Similar to expressions most combinations of a and b leaded to the same aprxiamted error and number of mistakes, meaning the training set or/and the testing set is not representative of the population

Videos:
·No combination of a and b could converge, showing that the data wasn't linearly separable
·Extremly High aproximate error shows that the error may be due to the selected features.
